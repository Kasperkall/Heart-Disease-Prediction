# Heart Disease Prediction Using Ensamble Methods

This repository contains the program of a graded project in the course TDT4173 - Machine Learning at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.



## Motivation
This project was motivated by the rapid integration of machine learning methods in the field of medicine. Since heart diseases rarely show any symptoms programs, such as ours, can have an enourmous impact on the speed and reliability of diaganosis and prognosis on patients who may have heart diseases. 


## Language and libraries

This program uses python 3.8.1 and the following libraries:
Markup : * SkiLearn
         * Numpy
         * Seaborn
         * Matplotlib
         * 


## Methods

The Ensamble Methods used in the project were:
Markup : * AdaBoost
         * RandomForest
         * Bagging
         * Boosting
         * Decision Trees


## Running the program

Depending on what editor you use the initiation will differ. The editor used in the project was Visual Studio Code and as such running the program becomes extensivly easy with the plug in:
