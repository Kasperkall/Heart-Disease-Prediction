# Heart Disease Prediction Using Ensamble Methods

This repository contains the program of a graded project in the course TDT4173 - Machine Learning at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.


### NOTE ###

The code is heavily commented and should be intutive for the novel reader.

## Motivation
This project was motivated by the rapid integration of machine learning methods in the field of medicine. Since heart diseases rarely show any symptoms programs, such as ours, can have an enourmous impact on the speed and reliability of diaganosis and prognosis on patients who may have heart diseases. 


## Language and libraries

This program uses python 3.8.1 and the following libraries:

         * Scikit-Learn (sk-learn)
         * Numpy
         * Seaborn
         * Matplotlib
         * Pandas
         


## Methods

         * AdaBoost
         https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html
         * RandomForest
         https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html
         * Decision Trees
         https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html


## Running the program

Depending on what editor you use the initiation will differ. The editor used in the project was Visual Studio Code and as such running the program became extensivly easy with the plug in: "Code Runner".
To add this extension in VScode go to the marketplace, type in "code runner" and install:

You can also use the terminal in your prefered editor to run the progr
It is also possible to set up a virtual environment with the required libraries: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial

Estimated run time: 18 sec

Open your virtual env and run python main.py
                          python data_representation.py
